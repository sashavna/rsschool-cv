# Brief information about me

I graduated from Belarusian National Technical University by specialty design-engineer. Now I work as a graphic designer. Since my last year at university and during my work, I have been trying to find what I want to do and, as a result, change my job. I studied different directions in design, but after a long stagnation, I am trying a completely new area for myself - programming. I think that my strengths are assiduity and responsibility, I am not afraid of learning new things. So my goal is to find a hobby-job that I will really enjoy.
